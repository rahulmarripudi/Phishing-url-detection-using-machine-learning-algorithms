# Phishing URL Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect phishing URLs. Phishing attacks are a significant threat in the digital world, where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information by disguising malicious URLs as legitimate ones.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between phishing and legitimate URLs. This detection mechanism can help prevent phishing attacks and protect users' sensitive information.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains URLs labeled as either phishing or legitimate. Each URL is described by various features extracted from the URL, domain, and web content. The dataset is not included in this repository due to privacy concerns, but similar datasets can be found on platforms like Kaggle.

## Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a critical step in building a machine learning model. The following preprocessing steps were applied:

- **Feature Extraction:** Extracting meaningful features from URLs (e.g., length of URL, presence of special characters, domain age).
- **Data Cleaning:** Removing or imputing missing values.
- **Normalization:** Scaling numerical features to a standard range.
- **Encoding:** Converting categorical features into numerical values.

## Algorithms

Several machine learning algorithms were evaluated for phishing URL detection, including:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Neural Networks**

## Evaluation

The performance of the models was evaluated using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **Precision:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall:** The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class.
- **F1 Score:** The weighted average of Precision and Recall.
- **ROC-AUC:** The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve.

## Results

The Random Forest algorithm provided the best performance with the following metrics:

- **Accuracy:** 98.5%
- **Precision:** 97.8%
- **Recall:** 97.0%
- **F1 Score:** 97.4%
- **ROC-AUC:** 99.1%

## Conclusion

The Random Forest model was the most effective in detecting phishing URLs. However, performance can be further improved by exploring more advanced techniques and feature engineering.

## Future Work

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Further tuning of model parameters to improve performance.
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combining multiple models to achieve better results.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying the most important features for the model.
