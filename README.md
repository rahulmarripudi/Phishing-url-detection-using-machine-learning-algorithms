# Phishing-url-detection-using-machine-learning-algorithms
Automated phishing URL detection using machine learning algorithms to enhance cybersecurity. This project leverages lexical, host-based, and content-based features of URLs, employing Supervised learning models for accurate, real-time identification of phishing sites.
Phishing is a type of cyber attack used to trick individuals  into providing sensitive information, such as login  credentials or financial details, through deceptive emails,  messages, or websites.
This project presents a phishing attack detection system which concentrates on detection of phishing using Machine  Learning (ML). It makes use of ML techniques which  include Logistic Regression, Naive Bayeâ€™s Classifier,  Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Gradient Boosting  Classifier  to  detect the phished messages.
